### Day 2: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Big chunk of work made on the module-mpp, moving the shared preferences on the common part without too much difficulties. The api key is not hardcoded anymore and retrieved from the web.

**Thoughts**: null

### Day 3: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another big chunk, I redesigned the MVVM classes to use the Moko-MVVM lib.

**Thoughts**: 
- Moko-MVVM is pretty neat: lifecycle aware and very similar to what is already existing on Android.
- Coroutines exception handling : I think in most cases it's a best solution to use the usual try/catch exception handler instead of a CoroutineExceptionHandler. Indeed, once a coroutine terminates with an exception, the attached CoroutineScope cannot resume another coroutine.
