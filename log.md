### Day 0: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on notifications, improving the message and I added an error notification. Starting to work on the logo with my designer.

**Thoughts**: Good communication is nice to have.

### Day 1: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Small work on UI, and I added a link to Paypal donation.

**Thoughts**: Little by little the bird makes its nest.

### Day 2: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Big chunk of work made on the module-mpp, moving the shared preferences on the common part without too much difficulties. The api key is not hardcoded anymore and retrieved from the web.

**Thoughts**: null

### Day 3: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another big chunk, I redesigned the MVVM classes to use the Moko-MVVM lib.

**Thoughts**: 
- Moko-MVVM is pretty neat: lifecycle aware and very similar to what is already existing on Android.
- Coroutines exception handling : I think in most cases it's a best solution to use the usual try/catch exception handler instead of a CoroutineExceptionHandler. Indeed, once a coroutine terminates with an exception, the attached CoroutineScope cannot resume another coroutine.

### Day 4: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: No progress on the TODO list, but I worked on refactoring package names and file names, improving the architecture and fixing a regression on Unit Tests.

**Thoughts**: 
- Putting the Presenter part from the MVP design pattern into the mpp library is unfortunately not possible (due to reference to MainActivity::class).
- Using an interface is a workaround to mock a class without an existing mocking library for Kotlin multipatform.

### Day 5: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I improved exception handling related to the network part in the module-mpp, and also the forecast pollution notification message.

**Thoughts**: Think of every possible exception that can be thrown by your IO classes.

### Day 6: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I fixed some bugs, improved the MVP implementation using data binding, and attached to the pending intent of the alert message the 'tomorrow' tab index. No much progress on what really matters on my TODO list.

**Thoughts**: Intent flags are not that obvious.

### Day 7: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did not really write code today, I was more into gathering tutorials on Material design and looking for a library to nicely display the global air quality value (found it! [SlimChart](https://github.com/mancj/SlimChart)).

**Thoughts**: Half-day on tutorials about Android Material design will be necessary.

### Day 8: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning more about material design, built my own Material theme. The content I used for learning:
- [Setting up a Material Components theme for Android](https://medium.com/over-engineering/setting-up-a-material-components-theme-for-android-fbf7774da739): explains the basics and gives useful resources
- [MaterialThemeBuilder](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/tree/develop/MaterialThemeBuilder): official project example to help you build your Material theme
- [MDC-101 Android: Material Components (MDC) Basics (Kotlin)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-kotlin/#0): first part of an easy codelab about Android Material Components (buttons and textfields in this one)

**Thoughts**: Today's acquired knwoledge confirms me that the Android Material Components permit to build a modern UI effortlessly.
